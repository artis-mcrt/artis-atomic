24/Mar/16 (Niall)

I thought it would be handy to write in this text document
instead of constantly sending emails back and forth and
that we have everything in one place.

For now I will forward on the adf04 file and corresponding
A-values for Co2+. Eventually I will send on the photo
cross-sections in some documented format. I’ll probably
do this first for the RAW cross-sections so you can 
manipulate them however you like. Then I’ll run off the 
Gaussian convolution for say ~ 200 points.

Files included: adf04_v1
                adf04rad_v1

**adf04_v1**
I have changed one or two things to the adf04 file, but nothing
really significant…

1) The first line is the title that has Z and the ionization energy
   of the 3d

2) lines 1 - 262 are the number of levels included
       1   3s23p63d7(4F)   (4)3( 4.5)               0.0000
       |        |           | |  |                     |
     Index    Config.   (2S+1)L( J  )           Energy in cm-1

3) -1 terminates header

4) (number_of_temps) (i=1,number_of_temps) - in Kelvin

5)  up(j) lo(i)   A-value    UPS(T=1) UPS(T=2) UPS(T=3)… UPS(T=notemp) NOT NEEDED
      2     1     1.00-30    2.94+00  2.94+00  2.93+00 … 2.83+00       0.00+00

   Effective collision strengths (Symmetric) for all
   temperatures between an upper and lower state. 

   *****IGNORE A-VALUES FOR NOW****
   
   The last value involves the infinite energy point for a high temperature 
   and the A-value outlined in one of the Burgess papers. We only have these
   in for dipole transitions but can be calculated using AUTOSTRUCTURE or 
   something. We shouldn’t need these

6) That’s about it! some termination and additional comments at the end…

**adf04rad_v1**

This file has all the corrected A-values and match up with the
level indices in the adf04 file. You can just as easily cut 
and paste them in, but I was playing about with this so
I just included it as a separate file. It also means you can
include other A-values if you have another set.

Hope this helps. 

Photo stuff will follow shortly, will give a basic example and
then run it off for more transitions.
